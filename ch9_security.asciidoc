== Introduction to Web Application Security 

Every newly deployed Web application creates a new security hole in accessing of your organization's data. The hackers get access to the data by sneaking through the ports that are supposedly hidden behind the firewalls. There is no way to guarantee that your Web application is 100% secure. If it was never attacked by hackers most likely it's too small and is of no interest to them. 
 
This chapter is a brief overview of major security vulnerabilities that Web application developers need to be aware of. We'll also cover delegated authorization with OAuth, and possible authentication and authorization scenarios for our Save The Child application. 

There are plenty of books and online articles that cover security, and enterprises usually have dedicated teams handling security for the entire organization. Dealing with security threats is their bread and butter, and this chapter won't have revelations for security professionals. But a typical enterprise application developer just knows that each person in the organization has an account in some kind of a naming server that's stores IDs, passwords and roles, which takes care of authentication and authorization flows. Application developers should find useful information in this chapter.   

If an enterprise developer needs an access to some internal application, opening an issue with technical support team grants the required access privileges. But software developers should have at least a broad understanding of what makes a Web application more or less secure and which threats Web applications face - this is what this chapter is about. To implement any of the security mechanisms mentioned in this chapter you'll need to do additional research.

TIP: A good starting point for establishing security process for your enterprise project is  Microsoft's Web site http://www.microsoft.com/security/sdl/default.aspx[Security Development Lifecycle]. It contains a number of documents describing the software development process that helps developers build more secure software and address security compliance requirements while reducing development cost.  

=== HTTP vs HTTPS 

Imagine a popular night club with a tall fence and two entry doors. People are waiting in lines to get in. The door number 80 is not guarded in any way - a college student checks the tickets and let people in. The other door has the number 443 on it, and it's protected by an armed bully letting only qualified people in. The chances of unwanted people getting into the club through the door 443 are pretty slim (unless the bully is corrupted), which is not the case with door 80 - once in a while people that have no right to be there get inside.

On a similar note, your organization created _network security_ with a firewall (the fence) with only two ports (the doors) opened: 80 for HTTP requests and 443 for HTTPS. One door's not secure, the other one is.

WARNING: Don't assume that your Web application is secure if it's deployed behind the firewall. As long as there are opened ports that allow external users accessing your Web application, you need to invest into the _application security_ too.

The letter "s" in _https_ means _secure_. Technically, https creates a secure channel over the insecure Internet connection. In the past, only the Web pages that dealt with logins, payments or other  sensitive data would use URL's starting with https. Today, more and more Web pages use https and rightly so, because it forces Web browsers to use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) or its successor Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol for encrypting all the data (including request and response headers) that travel between connected Internet resources. The O'Reilly book "High Performance Browser Networking" by Ilya Grigorik  contains http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000545/ch04.html[a chapter] with detailed coverage of the TLS protocol. 

The organization that runs the Web server creates the  public key certificate that has to be signed by a trusted certificate authority (otherwise browsers will display invalid certificate warnings). The authority certifies that the holder of the certificate is a valid operator of this Web server.  SSL/TLS layers authenticate the servers using these certificates to ensure that the browser's request is being processed by the proper server and not by some hacker's site.

When the client connects to the server via https, the client offers to the server a list of supported ciphers (authentication-encryption-decryption algorithms). The server replies with the cipher they both support.

TIP: The annual http://www.blackhat.com/[Black Hat] computer security conference is dedicated to the information security. This conference is attended by both hackers and security professionals.

If https is clearly more secure than http, why not every Web site uses only https communications? Since https encrypts all the messages that travel between the client's browser and the server, such communications are a slower and need more CPU power comparing to http-based data exchanges. But this little slowness won't be noticeable in most Web applications (unless thousands of concurrent users hit the Web server), while the benefits of using https are huge.

When entering any sensitive or private information in someone's Web application always pay attention to the URL to make sure that it uses https protocol.

As a Web developer, you should always use the https protocol to prevent an attacker from stealing the user's session id. The fact that the National Security Agency has broken SSL encryption algorithm is not the reason for your application for not using https.


=== Authentication and Passwords

_Authentication_ is an ability to confirm that the user is who he claims to be. The fact the the user has provided a valid id/password combination just proves that he is known to the Web application. That's all. 

Specifying the correct user id/password combination may not be enough for some Web applications. Banks often ask for additional information like "What's your pet's name?" or "What's your favorite movie? 

Large corporations often use the RSA Secure ID (a.k.a. RSA hard token), which is a physical device with random-generated combination of digits. This combination changes every minute or so and has to be entered as a part of the authentication process. Beside physical devices there are programs (soft tokens) that perform user authentication in a similar way.
Many financial institutions, social networks, and  large Web portals support 2-factor verification -  in addition to asking for a user ID and password, they send you either an email, voice mail, or text message with a code that you'll need to use after entering the right id/password combination.

To make the authentication process more secure some systems check the biometrics of the user. For example, in the USA the Global Entry system is implemented in many international airports. People who successfully passed a special background check are entered into the system deployed in the passport control checkpoints. These applications deployed in a special kiosks scan the users passports, check the face topography and fingerprints. The process takes several seconds and the _authenticated_ person can pass the border without waiting in long lines.

Biometrics devices become more common these days, and the fingerprint scanners that can be connected to the user's computer are very inexpensive. Apple's iPhone 5S unlocks the phone based on the fingerprint of its owner - no need to enter the passcode. In some places you can enter the gym only after your fingerprints are scanned and matched. National Institute of Standards and Technology hosts a discussion about using biometrics web services, and you can participate by sending an email to bws-request@nist.gov with _subscribe_ as the subject. 

==== Basic and Digest Authentication 

HTTP protocol defines two types of authentication: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication[Basic] and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digest_access_authentication[Digest]. All modern web browsers support them, but basic authentication uses base64 encoding and no encryption, which means it should be used only with https protocol. 

A Web server administrator can configure certain resources to require basic user authentication.  If a Web browser requests such protected resource while the user didn't login to the site, the Web server (not your application) sends the HTTP response containing HTTP status code 401 - _Unauthorized_ and _WWW-Authenticate: Basic_. The browser pops up the login dialog box. The user enters the ID/password, which are turned into an encoded _userID:password_ string and sent to the server as a part of HTTP header. Basic authentication provides no confidentiality because it doesn't encrypt the transmitted credentials. Cookies are not used here.

With digest authentication, the server also responds with 401 (_WWW-Authenticate: Digest_). However, it also sends along additional data which allows the Web Browser to apply a hash function to the password. Then the browser sends encrypted password to the server. Digest authentication is more secure than the basic one, but it's still less secure than authentication that uses public keys or Kerberos authentication protocol. 

TIP: The HTTP status code 403 (_Forbidden_) differs from 401. While 401 means that the user needs to login to access the resource, 403 means that the user is authenticated, but his security level is not high enough to see the data. For example, not every user role is authorized to see the Web page with salary report.

In application security the term _man in the middle attack_ refers to the case when an attacker intercepts and modifies the data transmitted between two parties (usually the client and the server). Digest authentication protects the Web application from losing the clear text password to an attacker, but doesn't prevent man in the middle attacks.

While digest authentication inly encrypts the user is and password, using HTTPS protocol encrypts everything that goes between the Web browser and the server.

==== Single Sign-on 

Pretty often an enterprise user has to work with more than one corporate Web applications, and maintaining, remembering, supporting multiple passwords should be avoided. Many enterprises implement internally so-called Single Sign-On (SSO) mechanism to eliminate the need for the user to enter his login credential more then once even if the user works with multiple applications. Accordingly, signing out from one of these applications terminates the user's access to all of them. SSO solutions makes authentication totally transparent to your application.

With SSO, when the user logs on to your application, the logon request is intercepted and handled by pre-configured SSO software (e.g. Oracle Enterprise Single Sign-On, CA SiteMinder, IBM Security Access Manager for Enterprise SSO, or Evidian Enterprise SSO). The SSO infrastructure verifies user's credentials by making a call to a corporate LDAP server and creates a user's session.
Usually a Web server is configured with some Web agent, which will add the user's credential to the HTTP header, which your application can fetch.

The future access to the protected Web application is handled automatically by the SSO server without even displaying a logon window as long as the user's session is active. SSO servers also log all login attempts in a central place, which can be very important to meet the enterprise regulatory requirements (e.g. Sarbanes-Oxley in financial industry or medical confidentiality in the insurance business).

In the consumer-oriented Internet space single (or reduced) sign-on solutions become more and more popular. For example, some Web applications allow reusing your Twitter or Facebook credentials (provided that you've logged on to one of these applications) without the need to go through additional authentication procedures. Basically, your application can delegate authentication procedures to Facebook, Twitter, Google and other authorization services, which we'll discuss later in the section on OAuth. 

Back in 2010, Facebook has introduced their https://www.facebook.com/pages/Single-sign-on/108568432501463#[SSO solution] that still helps millions of people to log on to other applications. This is especially important in the mobile world, where users' typing should be minimized. Instead of asking the user to enter credentials, your application can show the button "Login with Facebook". 

Facebook has published JavaScript API that allows implementing Facebook Login in your Web applications(they also offer native API for iOS and Android apps). For more details visit online documentation on https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/[FaceBook Login API].

Besides Facebook other popular social networks offer authentication across the applications: 

* If you want your application to have a button "Login with Twitter", refer to the Sign in with Twitter API https://dev.twitter.com/docs/auth/sign-twitter[documentation].

* LinkedIn is a popular social network for professionals. It also offers API to create the button "Sign in with LinkedIn". For details visit LinkedIn http://developer.linkedin.com/javascript[online documentation] for developers.

* Google also offers the OAuth-based authentication API. Details about their client library for JavaScript are published https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/javascript/features/authentication[online]. For implementing SAML-based SSO with Google, visit  https://developers.google.com/google-apps/sso/saml_reference_implementation[this Web page].

* Mozilla offers a new way to sign-in using any of your existing email addresses using http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/persona/[Persona]. 
* Several large organizations (e.g. Google, Yahoo!, Microsoft, Facebook) either issue or accept http://openid.net/[OpenID], which allows to sign in to more than 50000 Web sites.  

Typically, large enterprises would not want users  to use logins from social networks. But some organizations started integrating their applications with social networks.  Especially now, with the spread of mobile devices, the users may need to be able to get authenticated and authorized while being outside of the enterprise perimeter. We'll discuss it in more detail in the section on OAuth.

===== Save The Child and SSO

Is there a use of SSO for our charity application Save The Child? Certainly. In this book we're mostly concerned about developing the UI for the consumer-facing part of this application. But there is also a back office team that is involved with the content management that produces the information for the consumer. 

For example, the employees of our charity organization create fund-raising campaigns in different cities. If an employee of this firm logged in to his desktop, our Save The Child Web application shouldn't ask him to login. SSO can be a solution here.


==== Dealing With Passwords

It might sound obvious, but we'll still remind you  that the Web client should never send passwords in clear text. Use http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Hash_Algorithm[Secure Hash Algorithms] (SHA). Longer passwords are more secure, because if an attacker will try to guess the password  by using dictionaries to generate every possible combination of characters (a http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_attack[_brute-force attack_]), it'll take a lot more time with long passwords. Periodic changing of the passwords makes the hacker's work more difficult too. 
Typically, after successful authentication the server creates and sends to the Web client the session ID, which is stored as a cookie on the client's computer. Then, on each subsequent request to the server the Web browser will place the session id in the HTTP request object and send it along with each request. Technically, the user's identity is  always known at the server side, so the server-side code can re-authenticate the user more than once (without the user even knowing it) whenever the Web client requests the protected resource. 

TIP: Salted hashes increase security by adding _salt_ - a randomly generated data that's concatenated with the password and then processed by a hash function. 

Have you ever wondered why Automated Teller Machines (ATM) often ask you to enter PIN more then once? Say, you've deposited a check and then want to see  the balance on your account. After the check deposit has been completed your ATM session was invalidated to protect the careless users who may rush out from the bank in a hurry as soon as the transaction is finished. Otherwise the next person by the ATM could have requested a cash withdrawal from your bank account. 

On the same note, if the Web application's session is idling more than allowed time interval, the session should be automatically invalidated.  For example, if a trader in a brokerage house is not interacting with the Web trading application for some time, invalidate the session programmatically to exclude the situation when the trader stepped out, and someone else is buying financial products on his behalf.

=== Authorization

_Authorization_ is a way to determine which operations the user can perform and what data he can access. For example, the owner of the company can perform money withdrawals and transfers from the online business bank account, while the company accountant is provided with the read-only access. 

NOTE: Similarly to authentication the user's authorization can be checked more than once during the user's session. As a matter of fact, authorization can even change during the session (e.g. a financial application can allow trades only during business hours of the stock exchange).

Users of the application are grouped by roles, and each role comes with a set of privileges. The user can be given a privilege to read and modify certain data, while other can be hidden. In the relational DBMS realm there is a term _row-level security_, which means that the same query can produce different results to different users. Such security policies are implemented at the data source level. 

A simple use case where row-level security is really useful is a salary report. While the employee can see only his salary report, the head of department can see the data of all subordinates.

Authorization is usually linked with the user's session. HTTP is stateless protocol, so if a user retrieves a Web page from a Web server, and then goes to another Web page, this second page does not know what has been shown or selected on the first one. For example, in case of an online store the user adds an item to the shopping cart and moves to another page to continue shopping. To preserve the data reused in more than one Web page (e.g. the content of the shopping cart) the server-side code must implement _session tracking_. The session information can be passed all the way down to the database level when need be.

NOTE: Session tracking is usually controlled on the server side. If you'd like to get familiar with session tracking options in greater details, consult the product documentation for the server or technology being used with your Web application. For example, if you use Java, you can read Oracle's documentation for their http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E13222_01/wls/docs103/webapp/sessions.html[WebLogic server] that describes the options for  session management.

==== OAuth-Based Authentication and Authorization 

To put it simple, OAuth is a mechanism of delegated authorization. OpenID Connect is a OAuth-based mechanism for authentication. 

Most likely you ran into Web applications that offer you to share your actions via social networks. For example, you just made a donation and want to share this information via social networks. 

If our charity application needed to access the user's Facebook account for authentication, the charity app could have asked the user Facebook's ID and password. This wouldn't be the right approach, because the charity application would get the user's Facebook id/password in clear text along with the  full access to the user's Facebook account. But the charity app only needed to authenticate the Facebook user. Hence there is a need for a mechanism to give a _limited access_ to Facebook to the third party applications. 


http://oauth.net/[OAuth] became one of the mechanisms for providing a limited access to an authorizing facility. OAuth is "An open protocol to allow secure authorization in a simple and standard method from web, mobile and desktop applications".
Its http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749[current draft specification] provides the following definition:

_The OAuth 2.0 authorization framework enables a third-party application to obtain limited access to an HTTP service, either on behalf of a resource owner by orchestrating an approval interaction between the resource owner and the HTTP service, or by allowing the third-party application to obtain access on its own behalf._

Aron Parecki writes in his book "OAuth 2.0: The Definite Guide: _"Many cars today come with a valet key. It is a special key you give a parking attendant. Unlike your regular key, the valet key can only turn on the engine but will not open the trunk or glove compartment, or may not let the car drive more than a mile or two. Regardless of what restrictions the valet key imposes, the idea is very clever. You give someone limited access to your car with a special key, while using your regular key to unlock everything."_ This is a good example of a limited access to a resource in a real life. The OAuth 2.0 authorization server gives the requesting application an _access token_ (think valet key) so it can access, say the charity application.   

OAuth allows users to give limited access to third-party applications without giving away their passwords. The access permission is given to the user in a form of access token with limited privileges and for a limited time. Coming back to our example of communication between the charity app and Facebook (unless we have our own enterprise authentication server), the former would get a limited access to the user's Facebook account (just the valet key, not the master key). 

OAuth becomes a standard protocol for developing the applications that require authorization. With OAuth application developers won't need to use proprietary protocols if they need to add an ability to identify the user via multiple authorization servers. 

==== Federated Identity with OpenID Connect and JSON Web Tokens

There is a term http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federated_identity[_federated identity_], which Wikipedia defines as the means of linking a person's electronic identity and attributes, stored across multiple distinct identity management systems. This is similar to the enterprise single sign-on, but is wider because the authentication token with the information about the user's identity can be passed across multiple departments or organizations and software systems. 

Microsoft's publication called http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff423674.aspx["A Guide to Claims-Based Identity and Access Control"] includes a section on http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff359110.aspx[federated identity for Web applications] with greater details on this subject. 

In the past, the markup language http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Assertion_Markup_Language[SAML] was the most popular open standard data format for exchanging authentication and authorization data. http://openid.net/connect/[OpenID Connect] is a newer open standard. It's a layer on top of OAuth 2.0 that simply verifies the identity of the user.  http://openid.net/get-an-openid/[OpenID providers] that can confirm the user's identity include such companies as Google, Yahoo!, IBM, VeriSign and more.  
Typically OpenID Connect uses so-called http://self-issued.info/docs/draft-ietf-oauth-json-web-token.html[JSON Web Tokens(JWT)], which should eventually replace popular XML-based SAML tokens. JSON Web Token is base64 encoded and signed JSON data structure. While OAuth 2.0 spec doesn't mandate using JSON Web Tokens, they became a de-facto standard token format. 

To have a better understanding of how the JSON Web tokens are encoded, visit the http://openidtest.uninett.no/jwt[Federation Lab], which is a Web site with a set of tools for testing and verification od various identity protocols. In particular, you can enter a JWT in a clear text, select a secret signature and encode the token using the HS256 algorithm as shown on the diagram <<FIG10-000>>.

.Using Facebook API
*******
Facebook is one of the authorization servers that offer OAuth-based authentication and authorization API.  The online document https://developers.facebook.com/docs/javascript/quickstart/["Quickstart: Facebook SDK for JavaScript"] is a good starting point. 

Before using the SDK you need to register your application with Facebook by creating a client ID and obtaining the client secret (the password). Then use the JavaScript SDK code (provided by Facebook) in your Web application. Include the newly created app id there. During this registration stage you'll need to specify the URI where the user should be redirected in case of successful login. Then add a JavaScript code to support required Facebook API (e.g. for Login) to your application. You can find a sample JavaScript code that uses Facebook Login API in https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/login-flow-for-web/[this guide].

Facebook Login API communicates with your application by sending events as soon as the login status changes. Facebook will send the authorization token to your application's code. As we mentioned earlier, authorization token is a secure encoded string that identifies the user and the app, contains the information about permissions and has the expiration time. Your application's JavaScript code makes calls to Facebook SDK API, and each of these calls will include the token as a parameter or inside the HTTP request header.
*******

==== OAuth 2.0 Main Actors

Any communications with OAuth 2.0 servers are made through https connections. Below are the main actors of the OAuth flows:

* The user who owns the account with some of the resource servers (e.g. account at Facebook, Google et al.) is called _resource owner_.

* The application that tries to authenticate the resource owner is called _the client application_. This is an application that offers the buttons like "Login with Facebook", "Login with Twitter" and the likes.  The client application 

* The _resource server_ is a place where the resource owner stores his data (e.g. Facebook, Google et al.) 

* The _authorization server_ checks the credentials of the resource owner and returns an authorization token with limited information about the user. It can be the same as resource server, but not necessarily. Facebook, Google, Windows Live, Twitter, GitHub are some of the examples of authorization servers. For the current list of OAuth 2.0  implementations visit http://oauth.net/2[oauth.net/2]. 

To implement OAuth in your client application, you need to pick the a resource/authorization server and study their API documentation. Keep in mind that OAuth defines two types of clients - public and confidential. Public clients use embedded password while communicating with the authorization server. If you're going to keep the password inside your JavaScript code, it won't be safe. To be considered  a confidential client, a Web application should store its password on the server side.

OAuth has provisions for creating authorization tokens to browser-only applications, for mobile applications, and for the server-to-server communications. For the in-depth coverage get the O'Reilly book by Aaron Parecki http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920023531.do["OAuth 2.0: The Definite Guide"].


==== Save The Child and OAuth

We can distinguish two major scenarios of a third party application working with the OAuth server. In one scenario OAuth authorization servers are publicly available, in the other - privately own by the enterprise. Let's consider these scenarios in the context of our charity non-profit organization.

===== Public Authorization Servers 

A Facebook account owner works with _the client_ (the Save The Child application) . The client uses the external _authorization server_ (Facebook) to request the authorization of the the user's work with the charity application. The client has to be registered (has assigned clientID, secret, and redirect URL) with the authorization server to be able to participate in such OAuth flow. The authorization server returns a token offering a limited access (e.g. to Facebook's account) to the Save The Child application. The diagram <<FIG10-0>> shows a use case where Save The Child uses Facebook for authentication and authorization. 

[[FIG10-0]]
.Save The Child and OAuth
image::images/ewdv_1002.png[]

While the client application tries to get an  authorization from the authorization server, it can open a so-called _consent window_ that should warn the user that the Save The Child application tries to access certain information from your Facebook or Google's account. In this scenario the user still has a chance to deny such access. It's a good idea to display a message that the user's password (e.g. to Facebook or Google) will not be given to the client application.

Your application should request only minimum access to the user's resource server. For example, if the Save The Child application just needs to offer an easy authentication for all Facebook users, then do not request the write access to the user's Facebook account. On the other hand, if a kid was cured with the involvement of our charity application, and he wants to share the good news with his Facebook friends, the Save The Child application needs a write permission to the user's Facebook account.

The UI code of the Save The Child application doesn't have to know how to parse the token returned by the authorization server. It can simply pass it to the Save The Child's server software (e.g. via the HTTP request header). The server has to know how to read and decipher the information from the token. The client application sends to the authorization server only the client id, and not the _client secret_ needed for deciphering the user's information from the token.
 
===== Private Authorization Servers 

The OAuth authorization server may be configured inside the enterprise, but may serve not only internal employees, but external partners too. Say,  one of the upcoming charity events is a marathon to fight cancer. To prepare such a marathon our charity organization needs to use help of a partner company named Global Marathon Suppliers, which will take care of the logistics (providing banners, water, food, rain ponchos, blankets, branded tents et al.) 

It would be nice if our supplier would know up-to-date information about the number of participants in this event. If our charity firm will set them up with the access to our internal authorization server, the employees of the Global Marathon Suppliers can have limited access to the marathon participants. On the other hand, if the suppliers would open a limited access to their data, this could increase the productivity of the charity company employees. This is practical and cost-saving setup.

NOTE: The authors of this book were helping http://www.lls.org/[Leukemia and Lymphoma Society (LLS)] with developing both front and back end software.  LLS ran a number of successful marathons as well as many other campaigns for charity causes.
We also using https://developer.intuit.com/docs/0025_quickbooksapi/0055_devkits/0150_ipp_.net_devkit_3.0/authorization/0001_oauth_authorization[OAuth solution from Intuit QuickBooks] in the billing workflows for our software product for insurance industry at http://www.surancebay.com/[SuranceBay]. Our partner companies get limited access to our billing systems and  to our software can access theirs. 


=== Top Security Risks

https://www.owasp.org[ Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP)] is an open source project focused on improving security of Web applications. OWASP is a collection of guides and tools for increasing  security of Web applications. OWASP publishes and maintains the list of https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Top_Ten_Project[top 10 security risks]. Figure <<FIG10-1>> shows how this list looked in 2013:

[[FIG10-1]]
.Top 10 security risks circa 2013
image::images/ewdv_1003.png[]

This Web site allows you to drill down on each of the items from this list, see the illustration of the selected security vulnerability and recommendations on how to prevent it. You can also download this list as a http://owasptop10.googlecode.com/files/OWASP%20Top%2010%20-%202013.pdf[PDF document]. Let's review a couple of the top 10 security threats: injection and cross-site scripting.

==== Injection

If a bad guy will be able to _inject_ a piece of code that will run inside your Web application, such code can steal or damage the data from this  application. In the world of compiled libraries and executables injecting malicious code would be a rather difficult task. But if an application uses interpreted languages (e.g. JavaScript or clear text SQL) the task of injecting malicious code becomes a lot easier than you might think. Let's look at a typical example of SQL injection.

Say your application can search for data based on some keywords the user enters into a text input field. For example, to find all donors in the city of New York the user will enter the following: 

_"New York"; delete from donors;_ 

If the server side code of your application would be simply attaching the entered text to the SQL statement, this could result in execution of the following command:

_Select * from donors where city="New York"; delete from donors;_

This command doesn't require any additional comments, does it? Is there a way to prevent the users of you Web application from entering something like this? The first thing that comes to mind is to not allow the user to enter the city, but force him to select it from the list. But such a list of possible values might be huge. Besides, the hacker can modify the HTTP request after the browser sends it to the server.

TIP: Always use pre-compiled SQL statements that use parameters to pass the user's input into the database query (e.g. the _PreparedStatement_ in Java).  

The importance of the server-side validation shouldn't be underestimated. In some scenarios you can come up with a regular expression that checks for the matching patterns in the data received from the clients. In other cases you can write a regular expression that invalidate the data if it contains SQL (or other) keywords that leads to modifications  of the data on the server. 

TIP: Always minimize the interval between validating and using the data.  

In the ideal world the client-side code should not even send the non-validated data to the server. But in real-world you'll end up with duplicating some of the validation code in both the client and server. 

==== Cross-Site Scripting

Cross-site scripting (XSS) is when an attacker injects the malicious code into a browser-side script of your Web application.  The user was accessing a trusted Web site, but got an injection from a malicious server that reached the user via the trusted server (hence cross-site).
Single-page AJAX-based applications make lots of under-the-hood requests to the servers, which increases the attack surface comparing to traditional legacy Web sites that would be downloading Web pages a lot less frequently.  
XSS can happen in three ways: 

* Reflected (a.k.a. phishing) - the Web page contains a link that seems valid, but when the user clicks on it, the user's browser receives and executes the the script created by the attacker.

* Stored - the external attacker managed to store the malicious script on the server that hosts someone's  Web application so every user will get it as a part of the Web page and their Web browser will execute it. For example, if a user's forum allows posting texts that include JavaScript code, a malicious code typed by a "bad guy" can be saved in the server's database and executed by users' browsers visited this forum afterward.

* Local - no server is involved. Web page A opens Web page B with malicious code, which in turn modifies the code of the page A. If your application uses a hash-tag(#) in URLs (e.g. http://savesickchild.org#something), make sure that before processing this _something_ doesn't contain anything like "_javascript:somecode_", which may have been attached to the URL by an attacker. 

W3C has published the draft of the https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/content-security-policy/raw-file/tip/csp-specification.dev.html[Content Security Policy] document - "a mechanism web applications can use to mitigate a broad class of content injection vulnerabilities, such as cross-site scripting".

.STRIDE - Classification of Security Threats
*******
Microsoft has published http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc163519.aspx#S2[a classification] that divides security threats into six categories (hence six letters in the acronym STRIDE):

* Spoofing - an attacker pretends to be a legitimate user of some application, e.g. a banking system. This may be implemented using XSS. 
* Tampering - modifying the data that were not supposed to be modified (e.g. via SQL injection).
* Repudiation - the user denies that he sent the data (e.g. made an online transaction like purchase or sale) by modifying application's log files. 
* Information disclosure - an attacker get an access to the classified information
* Denial of Service (a.k.a. DoS) - make a server unavailable for the legitimate users, which often is implemented by generating a large number of simultaneous requests to saturate the server.
* Elevation of privilege - gaining an elevated access to the data, e.g. by obtaining administrative rights. 

NOTE: While we've been working on the section describing Apple's developers certificates (Chapter 14) their Web site was hacked and was not available for about two weeks.

IMPORTANT: One of the OWASP guides is titled https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Web_Application_Penetration_Testing[Web Application Penetration Testing]. In about 350 pages it explains the methodology of testing a Web application for each vulnerability. OWASP defines _penetration test_ as a method of evaluating the security of a computer systems by simulating an attack. Hundreds of security experts from around the world have contributed to this guide. Running penetration tests should become a part of your development process, and the sooner you start running them the better.

For example, the Payment Card Industry published a Data Security Standard, which includes a https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/documents/information_supplement_11.3.pdf[Requirement 11.3] of penetration testing.

=== Regulatory Compliance and Enterprise Security 

So far in this chapter we've been discussing security vulnerabilities from the technical perspective. But there is another aspect that can't be ignored - the regulatory compliance of the business you automate.

During the last four years the authors of this book  develop, deploy, support, and market the software that automates certain workflows for insurance agents. We serve more several hundreds of insurance agencies and more than 100K agents.  In this section we'll share with you our real-world experience of dealing with security while running our company, which sells software as service.  In addition to developing the application we had to set up the data centers and take care of security issues too. 

Our customers are insurance agencies and carriers. We charge for our services, and our customers pay using credit cards using our application. This opens up a totally different category of security concerns:

* Where the credit card numbers are stored?
* What if they get stolen?
* How secure is the payment portion of your application? 
* How the card holder's data is protected?
* Is there a firewall protecting customer's data?
* How the data is encrypted?
 
One of the first questions our perspective customers ask if our application is _PCI compliant_. They won't work with us until they review the _application-level security_ implemented in our system. As per the http://www.pcicomplianceguide.org/pci-basics.php[PCI Compliance Guide], "the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard is used by all card brands to assure the security of the data gathered while an employee is making a transaction at a bank or participating vendor".

If your application stores PCI data, authenticating via Facebook, Google or a similar OAuth service won't be an option. The users will be required to authenticate themselves by entering long passwords containing combinations of letters, numbers and special characters.

Even if you are not dealing with the credit card information, there are other areas where the application data must be protected. Take the human resources application - social security numbers (unique ID's of the USA residents) of employees must be encrypted.

Some of our perspective customers send us a questionnaire to see if our security measures are compliant with their requirements. In some cases this document can include as many as 300 questions.

You may want to implement different levels of security depending on what devices is being used to access your application - a public computer, an internal corporate computer, iPad or an Android tablet. If a desktop user forgot his password, you may implement a recovery mechanism that send an email to the user and expects to receive a certain  response from him. If the user holds a smartphone, the application can send a text message to his device.

If the user's record contains both his email and the cell phone number, the application should ask where to send the password recovery instructions. If a mobile device runs the hybrid or native version of the application, the user can be automatically switched to a messaging app of the device so he can read the text message while the main application remains at the view where authentication was required.

In the enterprise Web applications more than one layer of security must be implemented: at the communication protocol level, at the session level, and at the application level. The HTTP server http://nginx.com/[Nginx] besides being a high-performance proxy server and load balancer can serve as a security layer too. Your Web application can offload authentication tasks and validation of SSL certificates to Nginx. 

Most of the enterprise Web applications are deployed on the cluster of servers, which adds another task to your project plan: how to manage sessions in a cluster. The user's session has to be shared between all servers in a cluster. High-end application servers may implement this feature out of the box. For example, IBM WebSphere server has an option to tightly integrate HTTP sessions with its application security module. Another example is Terracotta Cluster, which has the Terracotta Web Sessions module that allows session to survive the nod hops and failures. But small or mid-size applications may require some custom solutions for distributed sessions.	

TIP: Minimize the amount of data stored in the user's session to simplify session replication. Store the data in the application cache, that can be replicated quickly and efficiently using open source or commercial products (e.g. JGroups, Terracotta et al).

Here's another topic to consider: multiple data centers when each one runs a cluster of servers. To speed up the disaster recovery process, your Web application has to be deployed in more than one data centers located in different geographical regions. The user authentication must work even if one of the data centers becomes not operational.

An external computer (e.g. Nginx server) can perform token-based authentication, but inside the system the token is used only when the access to protected resources is required. For example, when the application need to process a payment, it doesn't need to know any credit card details - it just uses the token to authorize the transaction of the  previously authenticated user. 

This grab bag of security considerations mentioned in this section is not a complete list of security-related issues that your IT organization needs to take care of. If you work for a large enterprise on the Intranet applications, these security issues may not sound as overly important. But as soon as your Web application starts serving external Internet users, someone has to worry about potential security holes that were not in the picture for internal applications. Our message to you is simple: "Take security very seriously if you are planning to develop deploy, and run a production-grade  enterprise Web application".

=== Summary

Every enterprise Web application has to run in a secure environment. The mere fact that the application runs inside the firewall doesn't make it secure. First, if you're opening at least one port to the outside world, a malicious code can sneak in. Second, there can be an "angry employee" or just a "curious programmer" inside the organization who can inject the unwanted code.

The proper validation of the received data is very important. Ideally, use the _white list_ validation to compare the user's input against the list of allowed values. Otherwise do a _black list_ validation to compare against the keywords that are not allowed in the data entered by the user.

There is no way to to guarantee that your application is 100% protected from security breaches. But you should ensure that your application runs in the environment with the latest available patches for known security vulnerabilities. For example, if your application includes components written in  Java programming language, install http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/security/alerts-086861.html[critical security patches] as soon as they become available.  

With proliferation of clouds, social networks, and sites that offer free or cheap storage people lose control over security hoping that Amazon, Google or Dropbox will take care of it. Besides software solutions, software-as-a-service providers deploy specialized hardware - security appliances that serve as firewalls, perform content filtering, virus and intrusion detection. Interestingly enough, hardware security appliances are also vulnerable.

In any case, the end users upload their personal files without thinking twice. Enterprises are more cautious and prefer private clouds installed on their own servers, where they administer and protect data themselves. The users who access Internet from their mobile devices have little or no control of how secure their devices are. So the person in charge of the Web application has to make sure that it's as secure as possible.
