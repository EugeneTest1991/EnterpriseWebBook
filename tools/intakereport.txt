   Once the figs are processed on /work, you'll need to add them to the book's repo in Git.

** Intake Report:
   (Git repo) tools/intakereport.txt

** MS Snapshot:
    To view the submitted files, you'll need to checkout the git tag named 'manuscript_to_prod' 
    by running the following command in your checkout:
    
    $ git checkout manuscript_to_prod
    
    This will temporarily switch the files in your repo to the state they were in when the manuscript_to_prod tag 
    was created. 
    To switch the files back to the current state, run:
    
    $ git checkout master
  
  
Notes from Tools:
=================

** Syntax highlighting: applied to 446 out of 455 code listings.

** Please let Tools know ASAP if there are any other global problems for which we can help automate a fix.


Notes from Dan:
==================

* Pretty much every cross-ref to a chapter is hardcoded :(

* There were lot of sidebars that had a first para that starts "NOTE:", which caused a note icon to render within the sidebar. I've changed them all to real notes.

* Many, many long code lines.

* Title page would look better with Anatole's name on same line as last author. Please adjust oneoff.css

* A few of the images are very large; watch to make sure art is correctly sized. 


==================

Please let me know about any other issues.

Thanks,

Dan
